HOW TO POST A TASK

Step 1: Click 'Post a Task'
From the main menu or homepage, click 'Post a Task.' Enter a clear, 
descriptive title (e.g., 'Assemble IKEA Furniture') and provide detailed 
instructions about what needs to be done.

Step 2: Set Location and Timing
Specify where the task needs to happen (address or postcode) and when you 
need it done. You can set a specific date/time or mark it as flexible.

Step 3: Set Your Budget
Enter the amount you're willing to pay. Taskorilla will show you the service 
fee upfront. Be fair, competitive budgets attract better Helpers!

Step 4: Add Photos (Optional)
Upload photos to give Helpers a better idea of what's involved. This helps 
them provide accurate bids.

Step 5: Publish Your Task
Click 'Post.' Your task goes live immediately, and nearby Helpers get 
notified. You'll receive bids and can chat with interested Helpers to 
finalize details.

Step 6: Manage Your Tasks
From your dashboard, you can edit task details, cancel if needed, or message 
Helpers. Once the task is complete, confirm completion and leave a review.

================================================================================

--- FAQs ---

Q: How do I become a Helper?
A: Sign up, complete your profile, verify your ID, and you're ready to 
   browse tasks.

Q: Can I accept multiple tasks at once?
A: Yes, but only take what you can realistically complete on time.

Q: How do I mark a task as completed?
A: Open the task in your dashboard and click 'Mark as Completed.' The poster 
   will then confirm.

Q: What if I can't finish a task?
A: Communicate with the tasker immediately. Unfinished tasks can affect your 
   rating.

Q: How should I price my bid?
A: Always enter your full price in euros (including time, materials, 
   transport, and fees) and use the Price Justification box to explain what 
   the poster gets for that amount. Once a poster accepts your bid the price 
   is locked in, so only commit to a number you are happy to honour.

payment method. This is required to receive payments as a Helper.

shown upfront before you post or accept a task. Helpers see their net 
earnings before accepting.

Step 3: Make or Receive Payment

For Taskers: When you accept a bid, you'll be prompted to pay securely 
through our platform. Funds are held until the task is confirmed as complete.

For Helpers: Once a task is marked complete and confirmed by the tasker,

transactions. You'll receive email confirmations for every payment.

--- Disputes and Refunds ---

DISPUTES AND REFUNDS
Last Updated: November 17, 2025

Taskorilla is not a party to agreements between Taskers and Helpers. Any 
disputes must be handled directly between those two users.

Taskorilla does not provide refunds for task payments unless there is a 
confirmed platform error, such as a duplicated charge caused by the platform 
itself.

We do not mediate disagreements, guarantee outcomes, or compensate users for 
incomplete tasks, dissatisfaction, or disagreements between Taskers and Helpers.

A: Meet in public spaces when possible, verify profiles, and never share 
   unnecessary personal info.

   help resolve it.

Q: Can I block a Helper or Tasker?
A: Yes. Go to their profile and click 'Block User.' They won't see or message 
   you.

Q: What if something gets damaged during a task?
A: Document it with photos, contact the other party, and involve support if 
   needed.

--- Staying Safe on Taskorilla Guide ---

STAYING SAFE ON TASKORILLA

Step 1: Verify Profiles Before Working Together
Always check a user's profile, reviews, and verification status before 
accepting or assigning a task. Verified users with good reviews are more 
trustworthy.

Step 2: Meet in Public Spaces When Possible
For tasks that don't require being at someone's home (like delivery or 
moving), arrange to meet in a public location first.

Step 3: Communicate Clearly Through the Platform
Use Taskorilla's messaging system for all communication. This keeps a record 
and helps resolve disputes. Never share personal contact info like phone 
numbers or emails early on.

Step 4: Protect Your Personal Information
Don't overshare. Your profile should include enough to build trust, but not 
sensitive details like your full address, bank info, or personal 
identification numbers.

Step 5: Document Everything
Take photos before and after completing a task. This protects both parties in 
case of damage claims or disputes about work quality.

Step 6: Trust Your Instincts
If something feels off, it probably is. Don't proceed with a task if you're 
uncomfortable. You can always cancel and report suspicious behavior.

Step 7: Report Problems Immediately
If someone is harassing you, acting suspiciously, or breaking platform rules, 
use the 'Report' button on their profile. We take safety seriously and will 
investigate promptly.

Step 8: Review Safety Tips Regularly
Check our Help Center for updated safety guidelines. Stay informed about 
common scams and how to avoid them.
