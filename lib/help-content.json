You'll be taken to the task creation form.\n\n**Step 2: Choose Your Form Type**\n\nYou'll see two options at the top:\n\n• Quick Form — A streamlined questionnaire-style form, great for simple tasks. Simply answer the questions and you'll be guided through the process automatically.\n\n• Full Form — The complete form with all options, best for detailed tasks. The steps below describe the Full Form.\n\n**Step 3: Select the Type of Help You Need**\n\nChoose one of:\n\n• Hire a Helper — For general tasks like cleaning, moving, errands, or handyman work.\n\n• Engage a Professional — For specialist work like legal advice, accounting, therapy, or marketing.\n\n**Step 4: Fill In the Task Details**\n\n• Task Title (required) — A short, clear name, e.g. 'Need help moving furniture'.\n\n• Description (required) — A detailed explanation of what needs to be done.\n\n• Task Images (optional) — Upload photos to help helpers understand the task.\n\n• Budget (optional) — Your budget in euros. Leave blank and helpers will submit quotes.\n\n• Category (optional) — Pick the closest category, e.g. Home & Garden, Business.\n\n• Sub-Category (optional) — Appears after selecting a category for more precision.\n\n• Tags (optional) — Keywords to help your task get found. Press Enter after each tag.\n\n• Required Skills (optional) — Specific skills needed. Press Enter after each.\n\n• Professional Roles (optional) — Only for Professional tasks. Select roles like Accountant, Lawyer, etc.\n\n**Step 5: Set Your Location**\n\n• Country (required) — Select from the dropdown. This is auto-filled from your profile.\n\n• Postcode — Enter your postcode and the system will auto-detect your location.\n\n• Location — Your neighbourhood or city name. This is auto-filled from the postcode, or you can type it manually.\n\n**Step 6: Set a Due Date**\n\nChoose when you need the task completed. This defaults to today's date.\n\n**Step 7: Post Your Task**\n\nClick 'Post Task'. If you're not logged in, you'll be prompted to log in first — your draft is automatically saved so you won't lose any details.\n\n**What Happens Next?**\n\n1. Your task goes live and appears in Browse Tasks for helpers to see.\n\n2. Helpers in your area can submit bids with their price and a message.\n\n3. You'll be notified when bids come in.\n\n4. Review bids, check helper profiles and ratings, then accept the best one.\n\n5. Complete payment — the helper is only told to start work after payment is confirmed.\n\n6. Once the helper completes the work, you can rate and review them.\n\n**Requesting a Specific Helper (One-to-One)**\n\nIf you've found a helper you like from the Helpers or Professionals page, go to their profile and click 'Request This Helper'. The form will pre-fill with their name and offerings. Pick a skill or offering from their list, or type your own. Fill in the remaining details and post. The task will be sent directly to that helper.",

Verified users with good reviews are more trustworthy.\n\n**Step 2: Meet in Public Spaces When Possible**\n\nFor tasks that don't require being at someone's home (like delivery or moving), arrange to meet in a public location first.\n\n**Step 3: Communicate Clearly Through the Platform**\n\nUse Taskorilla's messaging system for all communication. This keeps a record and helps resolve disputes. Never share personal contact info like phone numbers or emails early on.\n\n**Step 4: Protect Your Personal Information**\n\nDon't overshare. Your profile should include enough to build trust, but not sensitive details like your full address, bank info, or personal identification numbers.\n\n**Step 5: Document Everything**\n\nTake photos before and after completing a task. This protects both parties in case of damage claims or disputes about work quality.\n\n**Step 6: Trust Your Instincts**\n\nIf something feels off, it probably is. Don't proceed with a task if you're uncomfortable. You can always cancel and report suspicious behavior.\n\n**Step 7: Report Problems Immediately**\n\nIf someone is harassing you, acting suspiciously, or breaking platform rules, use the 'Report' button on their profile. We take safety seriously and will investigate promptly.\n\n**Step 8: Review Safety Tips Regularly**\n\nCheck our Help Center for updated safety guidelines.
